- No you don't have to pay a single penny (except for the Data charges xd) for any sort of exam or certification to complete this internship.
- The `Submit your Certification` is for those students who have completed this course in past during any program curriculum & gave exam to get accredited. So they can submit their certificate here & the course/module will be marked complete & they don't have to again watch through all the videos to complete it.

# TIPS & TRICKS

Write any tips for the learning modules or internship below. Thanks for contributing!üòÑ

1. You can use only `Sandbox 4 times` in a single day, so use them carefully when you perform exercises.
2. Go to [neverinstall](https://neverinstall.com/) on your pc & create an account with Google. Launch chrome there & open **FRT** and watch all the videos. It will provide you very fast speed internet, fast enough to watch all 5 videos at once.
