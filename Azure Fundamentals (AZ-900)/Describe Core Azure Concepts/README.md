# Introduction to Azure Fundamentals

## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet, which is otherwise known as the cloud. These services include servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence. Cloud computing offers faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

### Why is cloud computing typically cheaper to use?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a **pay-as-you-go** pricing model. It helps you:
- Lower your operating costs.
- Run your infrastructure more efficiently.
- Scale as your business needs change.
It is a way to rent compute power and storage from someone else's datacenter & you're billed only for what you use.

### Why should I move to the cloud?
The cloud helps you move faster and innovate in ways that were once nearly impossible. To power your services and deliver innovative and novel user experiences more quickly, the cloud provides on-demand access to:
- A nearly limitless pool of raw compute, storage, and networking components.
- Speech recognition and other cognitive services that help make your application stand out from the crowd.
- Analytics services that deliver telemetry data from your software and devices.
